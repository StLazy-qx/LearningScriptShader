Description
This project implements a modification of UV coordinates, where the amplitude of the sine wave increases as the UV grows. 
This creates a dynamic distortion effect for working with shaders.

Main features:
Variation of UV coordinates with increasing amplitude of the sine wave
Dynamic distortion of the surface
Studying and testing the work of shaders
Increasing the peak of the sine wave as the uv coordinates increase
